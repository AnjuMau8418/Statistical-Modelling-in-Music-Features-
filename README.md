# Statistical-Modelling-in-Music-Features-
Statistical modelling is a form of mathematical modelling that involves statistics to estimate or predict real-world behaviours, trends, and future outcomes based on data. It is primarily focused on understanding the relationships between variables and quantifying how certain factors influence outcomes.
In this project, I have used statistical modelling for music features, to identify and analyze different music features to determine the popularity of music tracks.
